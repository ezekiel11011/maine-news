MAINE, USA — This winter has been notably cold in Maine so far. December averaged more than 3° below normal in Portland and nearly 5° below normal in Bangor. Despite the cold, snowfall has been near or slightly below normal across much of the state.

Snow has been near or below average across Maine so far this winter

Portland has recorded just under 14 inches of snow this season, several inches below the typical 19 inches by this point. Snowfall has been closer to average in Bangor and Caribou, though Caribou is also a couple inches below normal. 

This may feel surprising, as persistent cold has allowed most snowfall to remain on the ground.

The winter pattern has been dominated by deep troughs in the jet stream over the eastern U.S., keeping cold, dry Canadian air locked over Maine.

The lower than you would expect snowfall this winter is partially due to continued drought conditions across Maine.

While the polar jet stream has been active, bringing cold temperatures and light snow, the subtropical jet stream has been unusually quiet. Big snowstorms often occur when these two jet streams interact, but that hasn’t happened much this winter, a common feature of our current La Niña conditions.

Below-normal snowfall also continues a broader dry trend across Maine. Over the past 24 months, only eight have seen normal or above-normal precipitation, helping drought conditions persist statewide.

Only 8 months in the last 2 years have seen above normal precipitation. 16 months have featured lower than normal rain and snowfall.

A major pattern shift, possibly including a move away from La Niña, may be needed to bring above-normal snowfall and precipitation later this winter.
