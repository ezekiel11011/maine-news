PORTLAND, Maine — A Catholic Maine high school is being brought back to life. But this time it will have a new address.

Saint Dominic Regional High School, which closed last year in Auburn, [is on track to reopen this August in downtown Lewiston](/article/news/local/lewiston-auburn/saint-dominic-regional-high-school-announces-plan-to-reopen-in-downtown-lewiston-maine/97-353d80f5-4363-473b-8100-40ceb6974875). The revitalized private Catholic school will be located in the historic Peck Building and operate independently of the Diocese of Portland.

“We are so looking forward to welcoming new students to a whole new opportunity and a new vision on how we deliver faith-based education,” said Susan Barton Young, a member of the Saint Dominic Regional High School board, which has led the school's return.

After the Diocese closed the school in 2025, many families were left devastated. In response, a group of local community members formed the independent board to relaunch the school on its own.

The board has since hired Dr. Claude Berube as Head of School and secured a new campus in the heart of Lewiston.

“The location is perfect... the parking garage, the security, and the opportunity to reimagine the space to best serve students,” said Berube.

The school has received significant financial support, including a newly created $1 million scholarship fund from Don and Cathy Dion aimed at helping families cover tuition.

Renovations to transform the second and third floors of the Peck Building into a school setting are expected to begin within six to eight weeks.

“We’re building on the old traditions of four generations of families who have been part of the Saint Dom’s name,” Berube added. “To continue that is incredible.”
