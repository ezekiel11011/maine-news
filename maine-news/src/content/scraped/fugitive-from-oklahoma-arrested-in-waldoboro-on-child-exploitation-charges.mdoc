PORTLAND, Maine — A fugitive from Oklahoma wanted for aggravated possession of child sexual abuse material was arrested in Maine this month. 

Investigators with the Northern Oklahoma Violent Crimes Task Force and the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) determined 56-year-old Jaime Oktay left Oklahoma and was hiding in Maine, according to a press release shared Monday. 

Oktay was located and arrested at home in Waldoboro by the USMS Maine Violent Offender Task Force on Jan. 9, the press release said. He will be extradited back to OK pending legal proceedings. 

Oktay is also facing charges of possessing, procuring, manufacturing, selling, or distributing child sexual abuse material. 

“Fleeing across state lines does not create an escape route, it creates a longer trail for us to follow,” said Chief Deputy U.S. Marshal Josh Taylor for the District of Maine. “The United States Marshals Service will track you, we will find you, and we will return you to face the consequences of your actions. There is no safe haven.” 

Anyone with information about the location of a state or federal fugitive should contact the USMS at MED.TIPLINE@usdoj.gov.
