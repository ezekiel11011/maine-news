PORTLAND, Maine — Technology all around us continues to improve, and in many ways makes our lives easier. However, there can be some unintended consequences. 

Dr. Allyson Coffin with [Align with Wellness](https://www.alignwithwellness.com/) in Yarmouth said she has been seeing more and more patients who come in with neck problems. 

She says many times it’s due to the amount of time we spend looking at our laptops, tablets, or down at our phones. The problem she says isn’t just in adults, and an increasing number of children are facing the same issues.

She joined us to talk about what she’s seeing in her practice, and some ways to help prevent it as well as some stretches that can help.
