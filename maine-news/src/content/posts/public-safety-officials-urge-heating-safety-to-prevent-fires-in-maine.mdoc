AUGUSTA, Maine — As temperatures drop, public safety officials are encouraging people to make sure they're heating their homes safely.

This time of year, the [state fire marshal’s office](https://www.maine.gov/dps/fmo/) sees a rise in fires sparked by various heating sources. Last month, there was a massive [house fire in Falmouth](/video/news/local/public-safety/space-heater-may-have-caused-falmouth-house-fire/97-7dded9e9-123d-4e5d-bad4-f9133d573971) that investigators said appears to have been started by a space heater.

[In Roxbury, a fire started by a wood-burning stov](/article/news/local/public-safety/roxbury-home-destroyed-in-woodstove-related-fire-no-injuries-reported/97-c4b0534c-161d-45de-997c-e57b294a3e9f)[e](/article/news/local/public-safety/roxbury-home-destroyed-in-woodstove-related-fire-no-injuries-reported/97-c4b0534c-161d-45de-997c-e57b294a3e9f) destroyed a home. According to investigators, it was most likely caused by an issue with the chimney.

“As the weather cools off, we see more heating appliances that cause fires,” Joel Davis, deputy chief of the state fire marshal’s office, said. “A lot of times they're an accident, but they're preventable.”

Davis said most of these heating-related fires are caused by combustibles that are too close to heating appliances. He said, with these kinds of fires, people are often using alternative heating sources like portable, electric, or propane heaters.

When using space heaters, Davis said the best way to stay safe is by following the manufacturer’s directions. He said heaters should be kept at least three feet from combustibles.

Electric heaters should be plugged into the wall directly, not into an extension cord.

With propane heaters, Davis said they should never be refueled inside.

“What we really encourage people to do is as it gets colder, check your smoke detector batteries, make sure they're working,” he said. “And just make sure that all your exits are clear.”

Issues with chimneys can also cause fires. Davis said regularly inspecting and maintaining wood stoves and chimneys can reduce the risk of fire.
