===

The freezing rain accumulation has been enough to warrant extra attention on the road.

**WEDNESDAY:** A transition to freezing rain began near the coast on Wednesday morning. The stripe of light freezing rain was not large in area; instead, it was a narrow band near the Maine Turnpike.

The overall look to this system is trending away from high freezing rain accumulation, but it's enough to warrant extra attention on the road. Expected snow accumulation up to around 1-3" inland, with less than that near the coast.

Snowfall totals in the mountains will be between 3 and 5", so it's not a giant dump of snow either. Downeast Maine will likely get mostly rain with afternoon highs topping out in the mid to lower 30s. North wind at 6-12 mph.

**LOOKING AHEAD:** We have milder weather on the way, with highs in the 40s starting Thursday and continuing into the weekend. Thursday looks like the 'pick of the week' with mainly sunny skies and highs up around 40.

Into Friday afternoon and evening, our next storm system moves in. With this one, rain will be the primary precipitation type, with temperatures staying above freezing for most. 

We'll catch an 'in between systems' day on Saturday before another clipper system moves in from the west. This one looks more similar to tomorrow's (Wednesday's) setup, with coastal rain, a transition to mixed precip inland, and eventually all snow to the north and in the mountains.

Stay with us for the very latest.
