GORHAM, Maine — A teenager is charged with arson in connection to a Wednesday fire at a vacant home in Gorham.

The Gorham Fire Department was called to 23 Towpath Road shortly before 3 p.m. for a reported structure fire, according to the Maine fire marshal's office. Crews arrived to find heavy smoke and flames coming from the left side of the building.

The home was uninhabitable, boarded up, and vacant for several years, the fire marshal’s office said.

Gorham firefighters, with assistance from the Windham Fire Department, put out the fire. No nearby homes were impacted, and no injuries were reported.

Gorham firefighters requested help from the state fire marshal's office. Investigators noted that a board covering a front window appeared to have been pulled down, and one boarded door showed signs of forced damage, according to the fire marshal’s office.

A joint investigation between Gorham police and fire investigators determined a 15-year-old entered the building and intentionally set the fire, according to a Saturday update from the Department of Public Safety.

The teen has been charged with arson and has been released to his parents. The department said the juvenile and his parents are cooperating with the ongoing investigation.
