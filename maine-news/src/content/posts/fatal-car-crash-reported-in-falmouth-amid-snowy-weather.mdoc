Amid yesterday’s snowstorm and slick road conditions, emergency services responded to a car crash on the Falmouth Spur near the eastbound on-ramp to I-295 north. Maine State Police and Falmouth Fire and Rescue arrived on the scene at approximately 1:57 p.m.

The driver, identified as 19-year-old Joamaliz Orozco of East Hartford, Connecticut, was transported to Maine Medical Center after her car went of the road and into a guardrail.

She was pronounced dead shortly thereafter, according to a news release from the Maine State Police.

Weather and road conditions were reported as the primary cause of the crash, and the investigation is ongoing.
