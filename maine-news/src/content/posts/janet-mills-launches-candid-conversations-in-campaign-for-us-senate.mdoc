PORTLAND, Maine — Kicking off what her U.S. Senate campaign calls a "candid conversations tour," Maine Democratic Governor Janet Mills attacked Republican incumbent and Republican Senator Susan Collins, President Donald Trump, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

Speaking to an audience of 50 people in a Portland living room on Thursday night, Mills warned about but could not confirm a possible, imminent surge of ICE agents being deployed to Maine.

“We've called. We've asked the question, ‘Are you sending ICE to Maine?’ Gee, no answer. No answer. And so, you can only say it appears they may be coming to Maine. It appears they may be coming to Portland. It appears they may be coming to Lewiston,” Mills said. "We stand for justice and integrity and peace, and if they intend to send people here—thugs, Rambo types, with dark uniforms and masks and guns, who may be untrained or very little trained, to come in and do a sweep and arrest people, detain people, we will stand up to them."

In her 15 minutes of remarks, Mills primarily criticized Collins for voting 94% of the time aligned with President Trump last year—according to CQ VoteWatch, her campaign said—including when it came to Affordable Care Act premium subsidies that expired at the end of December.

Mills said, "The cost of health care is skyrocketing, and health insurance skyrocketing, because the Congress has failed to act, and Susan Collins has failed to act, voting multiple times against extending the tax credits."

Mills also criticized Collins for approving almost all of Trump's cabinet picks, particularly his pick for Health Secretary.

Mills said, "Susan Collins is voting to confirm Robert F. Kennedy Jr, who's tearing apart our public health infrastructure, and tearing apart our trust in vaccines and the health of children."

Mills pushed back on Trump's executive power grabs. She said, "That's not the way it goes, Mr. President. Under the United States Constitution, Congress makes the laws. Congress enacts tariffs and taxes. Not you."

The governor blamed Trump for undermining the kind of clean energy investments, such as for solar and wind power, that she has supported in her two terms.

Mills said, "We fought during my tenure on climate change, moved forward on climate action, while this administration in Washington disparages and says it's not real."

Mills did not mention her primary opponent, Graham Platner, by name, but did offer a comparison.

“I'm the only one in this primary who's actually won an election,” Mills said. "I am tested. My life is an open book. I don't have any tattoos. Trust me on that."

One house party attendee asked Mills, now 78, how she would respond to the charge that she is too old to seek another office. Mills reiterated her pledge, if elected, to serve one six-year term in the Senate.

“I know that I can get there on day one without worrying about running for election,” Mills said. “I'm running for one term to get stuff done.”

Jennifer Southard, who hosted the party with her husband, likes Mills' experience: two terms as Maine’s first woman governor, following her breaking the glass ceiling as state attorney general and a district attorney.

Southard said, "I'm on Team Mills because I want to beat Susan Collins, and I think Janet Mills has the best chance to do it, because she's a proven leader, and she's a fighter."
