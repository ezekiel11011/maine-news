Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey responds to criticism over the city’s ICE cooperation in relation to a deadly DUI case involving an illegal immigrant, arguing federal enforcement 'chaos' is making communities less safe.

One week after video of a fatal shooting of a [Minnesota woman](https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/minnesota) by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent went viral, sparking protests and a national debate, a new poll shows a wide partisan split over whether the shooting was justified.

Fifty-three percent of registered voters nationwide questioned in a Quinnipiac University survey said they think the shooting was not justified, with 35% saying it was and 12% offering no opinion.

While 92% of Democrats surveyed said the shooting was not justified, more than three-quarters of Republicans (77%) said it was. Independents, by a 59%-28% margin, said the shooting was not justified.

[An ICE agent shot and killed](https://www.foxnews.com/us/new-video-shows-minutes-leading-up-deadly-minneapolis-ice-shooting) the 37-year-old Renee Good last Wednesday during a federal enforcement operation in south Minneapolis. Federal officials have said agents were attempting to make arrests when the woman tried to use her vehicle as a weapon against officers, prompting an ICE agent to fire in self-defense.

President [Donald Trump](https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump) and leading members of his administration have strongly defended the shooting.

But top Democrats, including Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and Minnesota Gov. [Tim Walz](https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/tim-walz), criticized the federal account of the incident and rejected the claim that the officer acted in self-defense. Minnesota has since sued the Trump administration, claiming the immigration enforcement surge in the state is "unlawful" and "unprecedented."

Good’s death sparked [widespread protests in Minneapolis](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/anti-ice-agitators-threaten-agents-chaotic-minnesota-protests-f-ing-die) and across the nation, with demonstrators calling for changes to federal immigration enforcement.

According to the Quinnipiac poll, which was conducted Thursday through Monday and released on Tuesday, 82% said they have seen video of the shooting.

Men questioned in the survey were divided, with 42% saying the shooting was justified and 44% disagreeing. Sixty-one percent of women surveyed said the shooting was not justified.

Four in ten said they approve of the way ICE is enforcing immigration laws, while 57% gave the agency a thumbs down on how it's handling its job. That was largely unchanged since [Quinnipiac University's poll](https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3944) from last July.

Quinnipiac questioned 1,133 self-identified registered voters in their new survey, which had an overall margin of error of plus or minus 3.7 percentage points.
