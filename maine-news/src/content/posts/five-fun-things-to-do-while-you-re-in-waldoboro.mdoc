Keri Lupien wants people to know there’s a lot more to Waldoboro than what most of us see passing through the Midcoast town on Route 1.

That’s where the landmark eatery Moody’s Diner is, of course. But just a couple minutes away is Waldoboro’s quaint downtown and a scenic town landing.

[With its space restored and mission renewed, Waldo Theatre is ready for its encore](https://www.pressherald.com/2021/10/03/with-its-space-restored-and-mission-renewed-waldo-theatre-is-ready-for-its-encore/)

Lupien is the talent and live music booking agent for the **[Waldo Theatre](https://www.thewaldotheatre.org/),** which was built in 1936 and extensively renovated and re-opened in 2021. She took a few minutes to share some of her favorite things to do and places to visit in town. Some are seasonal so check websites for hours.

**Where do you like to eat?**
---

I tell everyone that a homemade biscuit with butter and jam at [**Perch**](https://www.facebook.com/p/Perch-Cafe-and-Bakery-100095674895203/) is NOT to  
be missed. I could eat one every day for breakfast. Speaking of carbs, I love eating the wood-fired pizza at **[Odd Alewives](https://oddalewives.com/)** and then walking through the gardens that provide the toppings.  
Although they’re closed during the winter, it’s also a wonderfully cozy place on a rainy day too.

**Where do you go for a drink?**
---

**[Ida’s Wine Bar](https://thewaldoboroinn.com/idas-wine-bar)** at The Waldoboro Inn. Housed in the mansion’s carriage house, this is the place to go for a glass of natural wine. You’re just as likely to chat with a first-time visitor to Maine, a visual artist from NYC, a local businessperson or just enjoy the beautiful backyard gardens. In the winter, the local vibes at [**The Narrows Tavern**](https://www.facebook.com/NarrowsTavern/) provide a real sense of community, especially if you can catch a local music jam session.

**Where do you go to connect with nature?**
---

**[Riverbrook Preserve](https://www.midcoastconservancy.org/preserves-directory/riverbrook-preserve),** managed by Midcoast Conservancy, is a great place for an easy hike (or  
cross-country ski or snowshoe) on a nearly 400-acre parcel of land that has open fields, deep  
woods and beautiful meandering river frontage on the Medomak River.

**Where do you go to shop local?**
---

After you’ve gone to Riverbrook Preserve, you have to head to **[Morse’s Sauerkraut,](https://www.morsessauerkraut.com/)** a half-mile up the road. Besides their world-famous kraut, it’s a great place for unique stocking stuffers, a hard-to-find bottle of wine for a host gift, or the best “girl dinner.” Get some world-class cheese at [**East Forty Farm**](https://www.lakinsgorgescheese.com/east-forty-farm) and go eat it on the picnic tables down at the [**town landing**](https://cms9files.revize.com/waldoborome/2021%20Town%20Flyer.pdf) while you watch the tide change and think about how sweet Waldoboro is. Go to [**Delano Seafood**](https://www.delanoseafoodmarket.com/) for the clams — Waldoboro is one of the leading clam harvesting ports in Maine — for sure, but their huge selection of fresh and frozen seafood, beer and wine, and Maine Made gifts is fantastic.

**What’s a hidden gem in Waldoboro?**
---

I love [**Pinky La Rue**](https://pinky-larue.square.site/) for a wildly good curated selection of vintage clothing, vinyl and housewares. The owner, Natalie, is the coolest.
