MAINE, USA — Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows has paused issuing confidential, undercover license plates after a request from U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

According to Bellows, the Bureau of Motor Vehicles, which is in the secretary of state's office, received the request. Bellows, however, did not share when it received the request.

"These requests in light of rumors of ICE deployment to Maine and abuses of power in Minnesota and elsewhere raise concerns. We have not revoked existing plates but have paused issuance of new plates. We want to be assured that Maine plates will not be used for lawless purposes," Bellows said in a statement on Saturday.

The decision comes after [state leaders began warning people of potential increased activity](/article/news/local/portland/mayors-portland-lewiston-maine-warn-of-incoming-ice-presence/97-49460a3e-9611-433d-aa34-4bfce977d89b) from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents.

NEWS CENTER Maine has reached out to the secretary of state's office for more information.
