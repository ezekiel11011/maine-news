A significant weather system is expected to bring additional snowfall to Maine over the long weekend, following accumulations from an earlier event on Saturday.

The incoming weather is categorized as a coastal low, which presented a challenging forecast due to its shifting projected track. Earlier forecasts had shown considerable uncertainty, ranging from several inches of snow to the possibility of the system entirely missing the region.

Recent meteorological trends, however, indicate a shift to the west in the storm track. This adjustment has increased the likelihood of further snowfall across the state. Residents should prepare for a second round of winter precipitation during the remainder of the long weekend period.
