ROCKLAND, Maine — Rockland police arrested the RSU 13 bus driver on Thursday involved in the crash that killed a 12-year-old student last November.

Jeffrey Colburn, 65, of Camden faces a manslaughter charge, according to a [social media post](https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1C8ShuNUfw/) from Rockland police. A grand jury indicted Colburn, and the Knox County District Attorney's Office issued the arrest warrant.

Authorities identified Colburn as the driver involved in an incident Nov. 21, where 12-year-old [Brayden Callahan was struck by a school bus](/article/news/local/public-safety/rsu-13-student-hit-by-school-bus-rockland-intersection-rockland-maine/97-8f3d5f3d-161b-480c-aad8-71198069f4f8) after getting off at the intersection of Eliza Steele Drive and Broadway, near the Eliza Steel Apartments. He died later that day. 

Brayden had severe internal bleeding, a shattered pelvis, and a broken arm, according to his mother, Kelley Morse. Before he died, doctors told Morse that Brayden would be disabled for the rest of his life if he survived.

The Knox County District Attorney’s Office previously said Colburn was placed on administrative leave after the crash and had been fully cooperating with the investigation. 

In a preliminary police report, Colburn [told officers he did not see Brayden](/article/news/local/public-safety/crash-report-school-bus-rockland-rsu-13-investigation-fatal-student-incident/97-bef03248-a83c-46ca-bc42-bd3c7bc974a0). The report indicated he was not paying attention at the time of the crash. Colburn apparently began driving the bus forward while Brayden was still in front of it, hitting him with both front and rear tires.

“It is clear that the front crossing arm was no longer deployed” and that Colburn was leaning far over to the passenger side, the report said. “\[Colburn\] did not keep his eyes on the road after dropping Callahan off at the bus stop.”

Brayden's family, neighbors, and other parents said Colburn had been an issue for many years.

"We've all been trying to get him out of here. This all could have been easily avoided when we told them," Becky Finson, a neighbor and parent, previously told NEWS CENTER Maine.

Brayden's family [hired lawyers last December](/article/news/local/public-safety/rockland-maine-school-bus-crash-death-brayden-callahan/97-38f5ff72-abd1-4b2c-ad60-bbeac1598997) to file a lawsuit against the school district and Colburn.

Colburn was reportedly no longer employed by the school district last December.

The school district also [decommissioned the bus involved in the crash late November](/article/news/local/rockland-bus-decommissioned/97-c863d514-da4e-4268-8dd7-e7a4d84b0413), according to a letter sent to parents.

Since then, police investigated the incident through interviews of several witnesses, legal process and review of relevant records, consultation with experts, and assistance from state authorities and RSU 13, according to police.
