PORTLAND, Maine — It has been a busy weekend for snow. On Saturday, we saw a few inches of snow statewide from our first of two long-weekend weather systems.

You may have have heard us talking about the second system all week. It has been a tricky forecast—a coastal low. In the days leading up to the weekend, the projected track wobbled east and west, swinging from several inches of snow to a complete miss.

The guidance a day out is still pretty poor, but as we suspected, the latest trends support a shift to the west. What does this mean? It means the chance for snow has increased.

The snow amounts will vary based on the track of the low, but the highest totals will certainly be along the coast. Looking at a widespread three to six inches along coastal zones. In general, the farther you are from the coast, the less snow you'll see. One to three inches are expected north of Lewiston, Augusta, and Bangor through the foothills. Flurries possible in the mountains.

Snow is expected to start in southern Maine in the afternoon, spreading east and north overnight.

Snow should start to clear out early Monday morning. If you're working on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, the morning commute looks alright, but might be a bit slippery in places where cleanup is still in progress.

On and off snow showers linger through Monday, but in general we will be clearing out. Bitter cold and wind returns by Tuesday.
