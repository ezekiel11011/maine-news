LEVANT, Maine — Part of Stetson Road in Levant was shut down on Wednesday after a fatal crash near Ollie’s Market, according to the [Penobscot County Sheriff’s Office.](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=pfbid022w6RZYnVTBW8vk7vqfbYfKFVS5XX9DoVAerK5Ka5pstYuMnKd9C3uN1XuHeAUXzql&id=100064916611336)

The crash happened around 4:18 p.m. near the intersection of Union Street and Stetson Road East. Deputies say a lone vehicle traveling at a high rate of speed went off the road, traveled about 150 yards into a ditch, and struck a tree head-on.

The driver, identified as 28-year-old Libby Toothaker of Bangor, was the only person in the vehicle. First responders rendered aid at the scene before Toothaker was taken to Northern Light Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor, where they later died from their injuries.

NEWS CENTER Maine was on the scene of the crash on Wednesday evening. Stetson Road was reopened around 7 p.m.

The Penobscot County Sheriff’s Office Accident Reconstruction Team responded and completed a reconstruction of the crash. The sheriff’s office was assisted by the Levant Fire Department, Hermon Fire Department, and Northern Light Medical Transport.

The cause of the crash has not yet been determined. Officials say the investigation remains active, and no additional details are being released at this time.
