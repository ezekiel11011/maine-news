Long before Tyrann Mathieu received NFL All-Pro honors, the defensive back rose to stardom [at LSU.](https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/lsu-tigers)

Mathieu played just two collegiate seasons before his dismissal in 2012 and subsequent entry into a drug rehabilitation program. On a recent episode of his ["In the Bayou with Tyrann Mathieu"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoOCLN0GeYQ) podcast, the retired football star reflected on resorting to extreme lengths to preserve his college football eligibility.

The drastic decision to consume bleach to try to circumvent a drug test nearly cut Mathieu's life short. Mathieu, who became known as "Honeybadger," said he took the risk after seeing a post online touting bleach's ability to manipulate test results.

"I'm just scrolling, scrolling, and I come across some s- that said put a little bleach in your Coca-Cola," Mathieu said. "So I did that. … It felt like my whole insides was just like erupting. I end up throwing that s- up. At that point, I'm like, ‘I done ran out of tricks. I don't know what to do.’"

Mathieu also recalled attempting several methods to avoid producing a test result that would disrupt his college career, including using fake devices or other individuals’ samples during testing. 

"I done tried everything in the books," he said.

The 33-year-old said his experience with bleach caused more harm than good, adding, "It backfired."

Mathieu finished his freshman season with 4½ sacks, two interceptions and two forced fumbles. He was named the Southeastern Conference Defensive Player of the Year and a consensus All-American the following season. He never returned to the LSU football team after his dismissal, instead entering the 2013 [NFL Draft.](https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl-draft) 

The Arizona Cardinals selected Mathieu in the third round. Two years later, Mathieu was named to the first Pro Bowl of his career and became a first-team All-Pro selection.

Over his 12-year NFL career, Mathieu became regarded as one of the league's premier defensive backs. He retired after the 2024 season, finishing his standout career as a three-time Pro Bowler, four-time All-Pro selection and with 36 interceptions.

Mathieu played a key role in the [Kansas City Chiefs’](https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/kansas-city-chiefs) run to the Super Bowl LIV title.
