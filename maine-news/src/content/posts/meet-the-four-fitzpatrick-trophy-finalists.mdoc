**Connor Ayoob, Thornton Academy senior running back:**  The [2025 Varsity Maine](https://www.pressherald.com/2025/12/24/varsity-maine-football-player-of-the-year-connor-ayoob-thornton/) and  [Maine Gatorade](https://www.pressherald.com/2025/12/05/thorton-academys-connor-ayoob-wins-gatorade-football-honor/)    Player of the Year, Ayoob set Thornton Academy single-season rushing records with 2,102 yards and 31 touchdowns. At 5-foot-8 and 190 pounds, he combined great durability with speed and superior balance. In seven games against Thornton’s strongest foes, Ayoob averaged 30.3 carries for 235.2 yards and scored 20 touchdowns. He is Thornton Academy’s eighth Fitzpatrick Trophy finalist. He would be the school’s fourth winner, and first since [Michael Laverriere](https://www.pressherald.com/2017/01/15/thorntons-laverriere-wins-46th-fitzpatrick-trophy/) in 2016.

**Tony Bongomin, Westbrook senior linebacker:**  One of the most dominant defensive players in years in Maine, the 6-4, 210-pound middle linebacker is being hotly recruited because of his combination of speed, strength, length, smarts and exceptional instincts. A rare Fitzpatrick Trophy finalist who was primarily a defensive player, he made 172 tackles (68 solo, 104 assists) for the Class B champions, with 15 tackles for loss, seven sacks, five forced fumbles, four fumble recoveries and two interceptions, including an 87-yard touchdown return in a  [40-20 title game win](https://www.centralmaine.com/2025/11/22/westbrook-football-beats-cony-to-claim-1st-state-title/)  against Cony. He is Westbrook’s first Fitzpatrick finalist.

**Cordell Jones, Portland senior quarterback:**  Generally regarded as the best all-around player in the state, the University of Maine bound quarterback and linebacker [set Portland career records](https://www.pressherald.com/2025/09/19/portland-football-shuts-out-deering-behind-record-setter-cordell-jones/)  for touchdowns and scoring. The physical 6-foot-3, 200-pounder excelled on both sides of the ball. At quarterback, he completed 77 of 144 passes for 892 yards and rushed for 1,436 yards and 24 touchdowns. Defensively, he made 93 tackles (40 solo), seven tackles for loss and four interceptions. Portland’s 12th finalist, Jones could become Portland’s sixth Fitzy winner, and first since [Joe Esposito in 2015](https://www.pressherald.com/2016/01/25/portlands-esposito-takes-fitzpatrick/).

**Parker Morin, Cony senior quarterback:**  Morin led a dominant offense with precision and big-play ability, guiding the Rams to the B North championship. Morin completed 68.6% of his passes (153 of 223) for 2,703 yards, with 36 touchdowns against just six interceptions, despite sitting out the second half of five games. Morin also rushed for seven scores for a team that averaged 47.3 points per game. Cony’s only previous Fitzpatrick Trophy winner was [Ben Lucas](https://www.pressherald.com/2014/01/19/football__cony_s_lucas_wins_fitzpatrick_trophy_/) in 2013. Morin is the school’s fourth finalist.
