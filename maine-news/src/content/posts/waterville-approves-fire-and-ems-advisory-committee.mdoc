WATERVILLE, Maine — The city is creating a Fire and EMS Advisory Committee to review operations and resources for emergency services.  
  
The committee’s role is “evaluating and recommending strategies to enhance fire and EMS (emergency medical services) functions ensuring alignment with community needs and fiscal responsibility,” according to a [city document](https://towncloud-core-prod.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/waterville-me/meetings/item_attachment/attachment/2948/Fire_and_EMS_Advisory_Committee_20251216.pdf).

Plans call for a seven‑member committee made up of two city councilors, the deputy EMS chief, a fire union representative, a medical professional and two Waterville residents. Members will be appointed by the mayor and approved by the council.

The members’ main objectives include reviewing EMS public education, finances and revenue, call volume and operating costs. They are expected to report to the committee at least twice a year.

“How do we continue to grow with the growth?” Fire Chief Jason Frost asked during a preliminary council discussion of the committee.  
  
The date of the committee’s first presentation has not been set.
