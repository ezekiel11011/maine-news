**Gabe Perkins** _is the executive director of Inland Woods + Trails._

The days may be shorter and the temperatures colder, but here in Maine, winter is one of the best seasons to be outside.

I’ll admit I’m biased. I put on my first pair of skis at age 3, learning early how to move and glide across snow, and I’ve openly embraced winter ever since. Snow is the only form of precipitation you can truly play in, and a fresh blanket of powder opens the door to experiences found nowhere else: cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, wildlife tracking and much more.

Winter is just as dynamic as the growing season. Snowpack builds and recedes, freeze-thaw cycles reshape the land and the conditions shift from day to day. Each morning offers a new version of the landscape, and a new invitation to explore it. It’s a season that invites stillness and motion, often at the same time.

At Inland Woods + Trails, we manage more than 100 miles of trails year-round in Western Maine, including 25 miles of groomed showshoeing, cross-country skiing and fat-tire biking trails. You can visit us at The Bethel Resort located at 21 Broad St. in Bethel every day from 9 a.m.-4 p.m. into March. 

One reason winter recreation resonates so strongly is that it has a relatively low barrier to entry. With a pair of snowshoes or skis, you can take advantage of these groomed trails, or simply explore the landscape right outside your back door. Many communities support gear libraries, school programs and loaner equipment, helping to ensure that cost isn’t a deterrent. These efforts are important during a season when access to movement, daylight and fresh air can have an outsized impact on mental and physical well-being.

In the winter, our region comes alive. In my hometown of Bethel, for example, we welcome as many as 500,000 visitors over a three-month period. On Friday nights, the town’s population often quadruples. Those visitors support local businesses and bring a sense of vitality that carries us through the coldest months.

Bethel isn’t alone. Communities across Maine are increasingly recognizing winter recreation as both an economic driver and a powerful source of connection.

Across the state, land trusts are offering programming that inspires connection and invites people outside in meaningful ways.

Here are just a few examples:

[Downeast Coastal Conservancy](https://downeastcoastalconservancy.org/) is hosting a free Youth Ice Fishing Derby at Vining Lake on Jan. 24, welcoming kids and families into a winter tradition that builds confidence and community. In Aroostook County, the [Upper Saint John River Organization’s](https://upperstjohnriver.org/) Frenchville Dark Sky Observatory offers a different kind of winter magic — quiet nights spent stargazing under some of the darkest skies in the Northeast.

In the Midcoast, [Georges River Land Trust’s](https://www.georgesriver.org/) winter hiking club will explore woodland trails at the Langlais Art Preserve in Cushing in February, while [Greater Lovell Land Trust’s](https://www.gllt.org/) weekly “Puddle Ducks” program introduces young children and caregivers to nature through stories, short walks and play. [Presumpscot Regional Land Trust](https://www.prlt.org/) invites people to experience the season through a creative lens with its Winter Photo Challenge, running from January to March.

Southern Maine land trusts are equally active. [York Land Trust](https://www.yorklandtrust.org/) offers guided winter bird walks and full-moon hikes. [Falmouth Land Trust](https://falmouthlandtrust.org/) pairs snowshoe outings with hot chocolate, and is hosting a maple presentation by Passamaquoddy educator and author Minquansis Sapiel on March 14. [Midcoast Conservancy](https://www.midcoastconservancy.org/) at the Hidden Valley Nature Center offers ski clubs and naturalist workshops focused on animal tracks and deciduous trees in winter. On Jan. 27, the [Brunswick-Topsham Land Trust](https://www.btlt.org/) will host a presentation on climate change and fisheries with the Maine Coast Fishermen’s Association, connecting people to the outdoors through learning and conversation.

For those eager to explore more winter programming, the Maine Land Trust Network website ([mltn.org](https://www.mltn.org/)) offers a list of land trusts across the state, along with an interactive map to discover winter programs and preserves.

In Maine, nature remains big and bold across all seasons, and our well-being is inextricably tied to the health of our lands and waters. With only about 6.5% of the state owned by state or federal agencies, land trusts play a vital role in expanding public access. Through collaboration and stewardship, they’ve conserved an additional 12% of Maine — ensuring these places remain accessible, cared for and resilient through all seasons.

As visits to parks and preserves reach record levels statewide, there’s a growing recognition that winter programming offers more than recreation. It supports mental health, fosters social connection, strengthens local economies and helps people feel rooted during the darkest months of the year.

By embracing winter in Maine through shared experiences in nature, we’re building stronger and healthier communities, one snowy step at a time.
