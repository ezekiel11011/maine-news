Cape Elizabeth is considering whether to restrict parking along Shore Road and in some local neighborhoods near Cliff House Beach after some neighbors have complained about traffic and safety. (Ben McCanna/Staff Photographer)

Nonresidents may have to walk up to a half mile to access Cliff House Beach in Cape Elizabeth during the summer and early fall, if the town implements [a parking ban requested by residents](https://www.pressherald.com/2024/07/04/as-popularity-of-cliff-house-beach-grows-cape-elizabeth-looks-to-limit-parking/).

The town is considering banning parking on part of Shore Road and establishing a resident-only parking program for streets in its vicinity. 

Year-round, the town would not allow any parking on Shore Road from Woodland Avenue through 880 Shore Road, an area that fills up with parking for Cliff House Beach. Per traffic ordinance amendments approved by the ordinance committee, the ban would apply to resident, nonresident and commercial parking, including landscaping trucks. 

Only Cape Elizabeth residents – determined by a municipal recycling sticker –  would be permitted to park on about 20 side streets on either side of this section of Shore Road between May 1 and Oct. 1, significantly reducing the options for out-of-towners who want to access Cliff House Beach.
