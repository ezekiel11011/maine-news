Cumberland County’s top prosecutor said on Friday that she’s willing to prosecute unlawful use of force by federal agents.

Jacqueline Sartoris said she believes, after studying videos and [court decisions](https://apnews.com/article/chicago-ice-border-patrol-immigration-80e4a8c89850288e22cdc0b6b89d2c79) from other states, that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have been held to different standards and training from those local law enforcement.

Sartoris said in an interview Friday that ICE agents “don’t seem to understand that they have limitations under the law.”

Her comments come after officials and immigration advocates in Portland and Lewiston have said they are bracing a possible surge of enforcement action by ICE. A spokesperson for ICE [declined](https://www.pressherald.com/2026/01/16/feds-wont-confirm-whether-ice-surge-is-coming-to-maine/) earlier this week to confirm plans for enforcement in the area.

Sartoris said she would prosecute immigration officers who break the law, the same as anyone else.

She said she was exploring, with the Cumberland County Sheriff’s Office, the possibility of an online system where members of the public can upload videos that they believe show illegal use of force by ICE agents.
