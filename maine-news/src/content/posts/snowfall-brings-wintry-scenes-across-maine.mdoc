MAINE, USA — An overnight storm into Christmas Eve has set Maine up for a white Christmas, after all. 

Some Mainers dug out their rulers and stomped their way through the snow to measure totals [well over a foot in Androscoggin and Cumberland Counties](/article/weather/local-weather/maine-snow-totals-new-hampshire-storm-white-christmas-2025-national-weather-service-gray-caribou/97-1bd49705-106a-4ff6-a985-082414a3f4cb). Others cozied up inside and took in the view. 

Check out these wintry scenes shared with us by viewers. If you have some favorites to share, please send your photos and videos using [the Near ME tool on the NEWS CENTER Maine app](/near-me).
