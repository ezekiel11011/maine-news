PORTLAND — The storm that battered Maine's coast this weekend has left more than just scattered debris in its wake; it has reignited a fierce debate about the state's preparedness for a changing climate.

Beaches in Wells and Ogunquit saw sand dunes swallowed by surging tides, while working waterfronts in mid-coast Maine reported significant infrastructure damage. 'We haven't seen water levels this high since the riots of '78,' claimed local lobsterman Mark Davis.

State officials are scrambling to assess the damage, but early estimates suggest cleanup costs could run into the tens of millions. Governor Janet Mills has declared a state of emergency for the three coastal counties most affected.

Climate scientists at the University of Maine warn that this is not an anomaly. 'What we are seeing is the new baseline,' said Dr. Elena Rossi. 'Rising sea levels combined with more frequent, intense storm systems mean that our definition of 'safe' distance from the water needs to change immediately.'

For now, communities are coming together to rebuild, but the question remains: are we rebuilding for the future, or just waiting for the next wash out?
