PORTLAND, Maine — The mayors of Lewiston and Portland, along with Gov. Janet Mills and Sen. Angus King (I-ME) released statements Wednesday warning U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents could move into the communities soon. Rep. Jared Golden (D-02) and Rep. Chellie Pingree (D-01) also released statements Thursday.

Neither cities nor Mills have confirmed where they are hearing about the possible ICE activity.

Mills addressed the possibility of federal law enforcement operations in Maine in a video statement Wednesday evening. 

She said her administration has tried unsuccessfully to confirm whether any operations are planned, but is coordinating with municipalities, including Portland and Lewiston, along with law enforcement, to prepare.

"I have directed the Maine State Police to work closely with local law enforcement, as necessary, to provide whatever support is needed in advance of and during any potential federal operations,” Mills said. “If they come here, I want any federal agents – and the President of the United States – to know what this state stands for. We stand for the rule of law. We oppose violence. We stand for peaceful protest. We stand for compassion, for integrity and justice."

Mills urged anyone considering protesting to do so peacefully. 

"For those of you who may consider protesting, I fully support your right to do so, and I urge you to do so peacefully – to meet any hostility with reserve and resolve," Mills said. "Know this: Maine will not be intimidated, and we will not betray the values that make us who we are."

"For reasons of operational security and officer safety, ICE does not comment on any ongoing, upcoming or potential operations," an ICE spokesperson told NEWS CENTER Maine.

Lewiston Mayor Carl Sheline, Portland Mayor Mark Dion, King, and Golden also released statements about the possibility of ICE agents coming to Maine.  

**From Lewiston Mayor Carl Sheline:** 

_"It’s my understanding that there will be ICE enforcement in Lewiston soon. I urge residents and businesses to know their rights and have a plan of action if ICE stops them in the street, visits their home, or visits their business. As a reminder, Lewiston Police do not enforce federal law._

_I understand that this is an unsettling time for many of our residents. Lewiston is a strong city and we care about our community and each other. Please check on your neighbors and stay safe."_

**From Portland Mayor Mark Dion:**

_"Our community is anxious and fearful regarding the understanding that ICE is planning to send agents to Portland and Lewiston next week. We are a welcoming city. There is no evidence of unchecked criminal activity in our community requiring a disproportionate presence of federal agents. In that view, Portland rejects the need for the deployment of ICE agents into our neighborhoods. While we respect the law, we challenge the need for a paramilitary approach to the enforcement of federal statutes. The consequence of law enforcement should not be chaos and violence, which only results in making Portland less safe._

_The City Council and I stand, not apart, but with our lawfully admitted immigrant and refugee communities. I urge our residents to look out for one another. Know your rights and have a plan of action if ICE stops you on the street, visits your home, or arrives at your business or place of employment. As a reminder, Portland Police does not cooperate with ICE and they do not participate in enforcing federal immigration law. If you decide to protest or demonstrate, keep your efforts peaceful and consistent with the expectations for lawful behavior that we all share."_

**From Sen. Angus King:**

_"Like many in Maine, I have begun to hear rumors of imminent federal law enforcement activities coming to our state. Given the videos and headlines we have seen from operations conducted in other states – many of them reckless, heartless, and irreversibly destructive – I share the same worries many of you have._

_Maine believes in law and order. We enjoy that order because our state and local law enforcement authorities place a priority on lawful and timely responses to clear criminal threats._

_Abraham Lincoln once reminded Americans in the face of conflict to have faith that ‘right makes might, and in that faith let us do our duty as we understand that.’ In the days ahead, I want to encourage everyone to look out a little closer for one another and be mindful of the rights that our Constitution gives to every man, woman, and child in this nation. If you witness any lawlessness done cloaked in the cause of federal law enforcement, please alert your local leaders, state officials, and federal delegation."_

**From Rep. Jared Golden:**

_"I am aware of the rumors and have been in touch with local leaders in Lewiston about potential ICE operations in Maine. Given what’s happened in Minnesota and elsewhere, I know there are Mainers who are angry and afraid. For now, with so much uncertainty, I urge everyone with a platform to avoid spreading unsubstantiated gossip or fear. In fraught moments, we need to be careful with each other and our community."_

**From Rep. Chellie Pingree:**

_"We’re hearing reports that DHS could launch increased immigration operations in Maine in the coming days._ 

_I know a lot of people out there are feeling scared.  
  
Please know that I stand firmly with our immigrant communities and the people of Maine. We will NOT stand by as ICE, CBP, or any other agency tries to terrorize our communities and unlawfully abduct our neighbors.   
  
We WILL hold them accountable for any illegal actions they undertake.  
  
Stay calm, stay vigilant, know your rights, and help your neighbors. I’ll be sharing more updates as we learn more."_

**From Maine Senate Republicans:**

**_"_**_The Governor just gave her full-throated support to legislation that handcuffs our local law enforcement from cooperating and coordinating with federal immigration authorities. Now she claims to have attempted to contact them to get details of a potential upcoming operation. The hypocrisy of that cannot be understated,” said Senate Republican Leader Trey Stewart, R-Aroostook. “This is what happens when you have a Governor who puts political brinkmanship over the safety of Maine citizens. Her actions place law enforcement and the general public at heightened risk.”_

_**“**The Department of Homeland Security’s routine law enforcement efforts have occurred for decades under the past several presidential administrations. However, federal authorities today are forced to expend greater resources because of sanctuary state bills like LD 1971 and the refusal of our Governor to cooperate with the federal government,” said Assistant Senate Republican Leader Matthew Harrington, R-York. “This entire situation is self-imposed and self-created by legislative Democrats and Governor Mills. When federal law enforcement is able to coordinate with local law enforcement, efforts can be more targeted; and situations like this can be avoided entirely. The best thing for our communities would be for local law enforcement to be able to share their valuable insights with their federal partners."_
