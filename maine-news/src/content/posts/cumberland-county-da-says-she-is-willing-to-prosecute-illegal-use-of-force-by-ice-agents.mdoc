Cumberland County’s district attorney said on Friday that she’s willing to prosecute unlawful use of force by federal agents.

Jacqueline Sartoris said she believes, after studying videos and [court decisions](https://apnews.com/article/chicago-ice-border-patrol-immigration-80e4a8c89850288e22cdc0b6b89d2c79) from other states, that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have different standards and training than local law enforcement.

Sartoris said in an interview Friday that ICE agents “don’t seem to understand that they have limitations under the law.”

“What’s happening is the onboarding for ICE agents seems to be incredibly fast, and I’m not sure what instructions they’re getting about being mindful of people’s civil rights, their own legal limitations, and the need to deescalate and respect people’s basic rights to be free of fear,” Sartoris said on Friday.

A spokesperson for ICE did not respond Friday night to a request to discuss Sartoris’ statements. The agency [recently announced](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2026/01/03/ice-announces-historic-120-manpower-increase-thanks-recruitment-campaign-brought) it has hired 12,000 more agents over four months.
