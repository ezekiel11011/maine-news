The Midcoast region is beginning its annual cycle of organizational meetings required for active nonprofit and not-for-profit entities as the 2026 calendar year commences.

They also function as key opportunities for members and stakeholders to review strategic plans, welcome new leadership, and facilitate networking.

A significant update involves the local Chamber, which has set its Annual Meeting for February 5th. This date represents a departure from the traditional January scheduling.
