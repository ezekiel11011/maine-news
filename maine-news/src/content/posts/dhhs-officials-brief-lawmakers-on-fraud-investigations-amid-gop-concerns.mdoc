AUGUSTA, Maine — Officials with the Maine Department of Health and Human Services were at the State House Wednesday to brief lawmakers on how the department investigates fraud across its programs.

The meeting was requested by the Legislature’s Health and Human Services Committee two weeks ago and comes amid [increased calls from Republican lawmakers](/article/news/politics/maine-politics/maine-republicans-investigation-alleged-mainecare-fraud-maine/97-1ab4b8f1-0df2-4c16-9705-255d3189191f) to investigate fraud, particularly following the [audit of Gateway Community Services](/article/news/investigations/state-audit-federal-probe-fraud-gateway-community-services-maine-medicaid/97-c4abeb4d-634e-4b0c-b079-4e3d0059bd5c).

Although fraud has become a [top priority for State House Republicans](/article/news/politics/maine-politics/maine-lawmakers-first-day-new-legislative-session-augusta-republican-democrat/97-c281b925-e1a4-4d02-be00-10eb709d35de), legislators were told they would not hear details about any specific cases during the briefing. Instead, the hearing focused on how DHHS is structured to detect and investigate fraud, what each oversight unit is responsible for, and how many staff members are assigned to that work.

Lawmakers heard from leaders of three separate auditing and investigative groups within the department. Those include the Division of Audit, the Fraud Investigation and Recovery Unit, and the MaineCare Program Integrity Unit.

The Division of Audit reviews spending across the entire department, including contracts within DHHS and MaineCare. The Fraud Investigation and Recovery Unit focuses on individuals accused of defrauding the department, such as cases involving stolen SNAP benefits. The MaineCare Program Integrity Unit investigates providers enrolled in MaineCare and was the unit responsible for auditing [Gateway Community Services](/article/news/local/courts-news/counseling-organization-in-maine-denies-accusations-of-mainecare-fraud-calling-reporting-false-dhhs/97-72645b6f-dc23-438f-a5df-fd278202fa59).

Leadership from all three groups outlined what they investigate, how investigations are conducted, and how many staff members they have to investigate. Each unit reported relatively small staffing levels given the size of the programs they oversee.

The Division of Audit currently employs 24 people. The Fraud Investigation and Recovery Unit has 15 investigators, while the MaineCare Program Integrity Unit has 11 staff members. Lawmakers questioned whether those staffing levels are adequate to handle the workload.

Tony Madden, deputy director of the Division of Audit, said that any team would want additional staff.

“I think we're doing the best we can with the personnel that we have,” Madden said. “It's been a difficult hiring process to maintain the amount of qualified people that we have in the office.”

Bill Logan, who oversees the MaineCare Program Integrity Unit, told lawmakers his team is responsible for monitoring more than 5,200 MaineCare providers statewide. Not all of those providers actively bill the program, he said, noting that some may be out-of-state hospitals or providers that only bill occasionally.

“Like a dentist, or another MaineCare provider,” said Logan. “There are a lot.”

Logan said his unit relies on eight analysts to review billing activity and identify potential concerns among those thousands of providers.

Each of the three DHHS oversight groups also shared data on how many investigations they conduct each year. While the numbers varied from unit to unit, officials said those figures are consistent with what they have seen in recent years.
