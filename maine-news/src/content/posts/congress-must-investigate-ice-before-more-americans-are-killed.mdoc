Americans seem deeply divided on many issues. But, there is one thing that we should be able to agree upon. A masked police force operating far beyond its legal authority should not be going around America harassing, assaulting, threatening, and even killing people.

That is what Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents are increasingly doing. The mission of ICE is to enforce immigration laws. ICE agents are [not typical police officers](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp80ljjd5rwo). They have very limited authority to restrict the activities of American citizens.

Yet, as anyone who’s watched the [numerous videos](https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/09/us/ice-shooting-minneapolis-renee-good-cell-phone-invs) of the incident has seen, an ICE agent last week fired three shots at Renee Good, who was sitting in her vehicle on a street in Minneapolis. Good was killed by the gunfire.

We can argue, as the Trump administration wants us to, about whether Good should have been [monitoring and protesting](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/10/us/rennee-good-ice-shooting-minnesota.html#:~:text=When%20she%20was%20killed%2C%20Ms,%E2%80%9Chelper%E2...
