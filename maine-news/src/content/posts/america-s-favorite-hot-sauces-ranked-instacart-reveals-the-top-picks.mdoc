Everyone has their own [favorite hot sauce](https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink) — but only one has ascended to the top, according to a recent report.

InstaCart, one of America's most popular grocery delivery services, released its ranking of America's favorite hot sauces.

The recent ranking was based on how many hot sauces were sold on Instacart between Jan. 1 and Sept. 30 of last year.

In the report, Instacart said 2025 [hot sauce trends](https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/food/food-trends) were "full of bold comebacks, regional standouts and creative product mashups that prove America's love of all things spicy is stronger than ever."

Below are the 10 top-selling hot sauces, top to bottom.
