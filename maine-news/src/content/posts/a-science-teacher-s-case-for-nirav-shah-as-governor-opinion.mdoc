Science education and evidence-based decision-making face significant challenges nationally, consequences that will inevitably impact Maine. As a long-time science teacher, the author argues that Maine’s future success in sectors like biotech, marine science, and renewable energy requires a leader capable of critically assessing complex problems using data and evidence—qualities embodied by Dr. Nirav Shah.

Dr. Shah’s leadership during the pandemic, particularly as head of the Maine CDC, demonstrated this capacity. He provided clarity and compassion while remaining focused on scientific evidence and transparency, prioritizing public health despite intense national political pressure and misinformation. Shah’s ability to translate complex scientific data into actionable information for the public is presented as a crucial attribute necessary for effective governance in an increasingly complex world. Therefore, the author advocates for Shah as the necessary gubernatorial candidate to ground Maine’s future in scientific understanding.
