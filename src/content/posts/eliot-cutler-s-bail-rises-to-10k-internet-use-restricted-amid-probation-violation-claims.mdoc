ELLSWORTH, Maine — Eliot Cutler’s bail has increased to $10,000 and he's barred from using the internet following a [prison arraignment in Hancock County Superior Court](/article/news/local/courts-news/eliot-cutler-accused-of-violating-bail-conditions/97-83c4368c-8161-4b4b-b0b1-82b14763ef58), where he appeared remotely.   

According to court documents, Cutler has been most recently accused of possessing more than two dozen screenshots showing sexually explicit material in December and January. Judge Harold Stewart imposed stricter restrictions regarding the alleged bail and probation violations.

"The supervision plan isn't working right now,” Stewart said in court. “All I’m doing is putting a band-aid on this to get us through the end,” he continued.   
  
In addition to increased bail, Cutler will only be allowed to access the internet when approved by his probation officer. He is also not allowed to access material showing a person nude.

This comes as the 79-year-old faces a probation revocation case over accusations that he accessed sexually explicit websites and used unmonitored electronic devices – which he denied in court in December.  Those alleged actions are in violation of probation terms following his 2023 conviction for possessing sexually explicit pictures of children under the age of 12.

Cutler is less than two years into a six-year probation sentence.  
  
He is scheduled to be back in court on Feb. 20 for previous probation revocation charges and is scheduled for a dispositional conference on March 12 for the new charges.
