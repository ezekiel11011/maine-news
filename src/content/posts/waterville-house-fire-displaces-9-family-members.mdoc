WATERVILLE, Maine — A house fire in Waterville early Wednesday morning displaced nine family members.

The Waterville Fire Department was called to a home on Chase Avenue around 3:15 a.m., according to a news release from the department.

Firefighters quickly extinguished the blaze, but the home suffered extensive fire and water damage, Waterville fire officials said. Nine family members were displaced, and the Red Cross is assisting.

One person was reportedly transported for smoke inhalation.

A section of Chase Avenue was closed due to the fire.

The closure affected Chase Avenue between 1st Rangeway and Martin Avenue as Waterville Fire and Rescue crews responded to the scene, police said in a social media post. Mutual aid partners also assisted.

The fire marshal is investigating the cause of the fire.
