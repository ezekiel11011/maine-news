AUGUSTA, Maine — The thrill of visiting a casino could be found at someplace as humble as your local VFW hall - that is if supporters of [LD 1902](https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&&p=e0c67c4ce10990875f49ed623efd30643f6b75c121f92d0ba7f74518896fcddaJmltdHM9MTc2ODM0ODgwMA&ptn=3&ver=2&hsh=4&fclid=0a239518-fe0a-6969-130b-818cff686868&psq=LD+1902&u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly9sZWdpc2xhdHVyZS5tYWluZS5nb3YvbGVnaXMvYmlsbHMvZGlzcGxheV9wcy5hc3A_c251bT0xMzAmbGQ9MTkwMg) get their way.

The proposal would allow electronic pull-tab machines, similar to slot machines, to be used by nonprofits across the state. Supporters argue the change would generate much-needed revenue for charities, while opponents say it could create unintended consequences for Maine’s gaming industry.

Parker Laite, a Navy reservist and executive director of the Brave Maine Veterans Coalition, said the machines could be a financial lifeline for organizations like VFW posts.

“It should raise a lot of money for charities,” Laite said after speaking before the legislature’s Committee on Veterans and Legal Affairs.

Maine law already allows nonprofit organizations to sell paper pull tabs, but Laite says VFWs are struggling to attract younger audiences, and he believes the new electronic gambling machines could help.

“They have an aging membership, which means they only have a very limited amount of dues that they’re drawing from,” Laite explained.

Under the proposal, it wouldn’t just be veterans’ organizations that could benefit. All eligible nonprofits could operate electronic pull-tab machines.

Not everyone is convinced that’s a good idea.

Patrick Woodcock, director of the Maine State Chamber of Commerce, says slot-style machines are heavily regulated for a reason. He and others worry nonprofits may not have the same level of security or oversight as licensed casinos.

“Slot machines is a pretty big step,” Woodcock said.

There are also concerns about economic impact. Critics argue that dozens or even hundreds of machines spread across the state could pull customers away from Maine’s two casinos in Oxford and Bangor, potentially hurting tourism and local economies.

Dan Cashman, who represents [Hollywood Casino](https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&&p=9b68ac7d46bafc0c2c5d6666f0af402aa7a3b7f9f86fc414ea29a555d0469161JmltdHM9MTc2ODM0ODgwMA&ptn=3&ver=2&hsh=4&fclid=0a239518-fe0a-6969-130b-818cff686868&psq=hollywood+casino&u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaG9sbHl3b29kY2FzaW5vYmFuZ29yLmNvbS8) in Bangor and grew up in the city, said the casino has played a major role in revitalizing the surrounding area.

Cashman also points to recent changes, including the [expansion of online gaming rights for the Wabanaki Nations](/article/news/politics/maine-politics/wabanaki-nations-online-gambling-maine-tribal-gaming-law/97-424331f3-a9ae-49ab-a309-619288158a38), saying combined shifts in gambling policy could threaten casino jobs, tax revenue, and the nonprofits that currently benefit from casino partnerships.

“I don’t want to say disaster, but it’s a recipe for a grossly negative situation,” Cashman said.

A representative for [Arrow International](https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&&p=8db0ddbc711df470e45eaddd918574a9419de4aa7cc2494861dfed13eeafedd7JmltdHM9MTc2ODM0ODgwMA&ptn=3&ver=2&hsh=4&fclid=0a239518-fe0a-6969-130b-818cff686868&psq=arrow+international&u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXJyb3dpbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLmNvbS8), one of two companies that manufacture pull-tab machines, said similar systems are already operating in 11 states without harming commercial casinos.

Lawmakers will ultimately decide whether Maine moves forward with expanded electronic charitable gaming, weighing potential benefits for nonprofits against broader economic concerns.
