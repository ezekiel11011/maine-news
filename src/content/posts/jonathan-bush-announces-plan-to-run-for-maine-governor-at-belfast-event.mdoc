BELFAST, Maine — A member of the Bush family has announced plans to run for office in Maine. 

Jonathan Bush, a cousin of former President George W. Bush and nephew of the late President George H. W. Bush, is setting his sights on the Republican nomination for Maine governor next year. 

Bush held an event Wednesday in Belfast, where he shared his plans to run in an increasingly crowded gubernatorial race.

The 56-year-old who lives in Cape Elizabeth with his wife and their two young children has never run for elective office before. He also has five children with his first wife.

The announcement was held at the operations center for [athenahealth](https://www.athenahealth.com/), a health care technology company that Bush helped found back in 1997. 

Bush is credited with moving the operations center to Belfast back in 2008, and he likes to say the move sustained 1,000 jobs in the midcoast region. It also had $1 billion in annual revenue. He resigned as CEO in 2018 and now has a new company in the same field. 

Within the past year, Bush has hosted a podcast called "Maine for Keeps," where he waded into political issues with his guests with particular focus in economics

With current Gov. Janet Mills term-limited after winning two terms, this race has attracted many hopefuls. The Republican and Democratic gubernatorial primaries will be held in June 2026.
