Fox News Digital has reached out to McBride's office.

Other [House Republicans](https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/house-of-representatives/republicans) expressed their support for their colleague's move.

"Tim 'Sarah' McBride is a man. Appreciate @Rep\_Clyde for acknowledging this basic biological truth on the House floor," Rep. Mary Miller of Illinois noted in a [post](https://x.com/RepMaryMiller/status/2011207066241630379).
